## Notes
* The cursor will remain "Busy" when saving fonts while you do other stuff in the background.
* All versions allows you to save all unaltered opened fonts from the menu (**File: Save All**) but not in the Standard toolbar. In double-byte versions of Windows, the system may display a critical error saying "List index out of bounds (0)". Single-byte versions of Windows does nothing.
* If you exit the program, it may create invalid font(s) and play the Critical Stop sound from the PC speakers.
* The program displays the "Access violation" when closing after doing some operations – the font(s) may be invalid.
* Any glyph stored in the clipboard in version 1.0 until 6.0 will have either the words **Glyph Contours** for contours or **Glyph Data** for the entire glyph.
* Any glyph stored in the clipboard in version 7.0 will have **Font Data**.
* The **Delete** item in the **Edit** menu is not dimmed on startup or when closing other dialogs.
* **Complete Composites** (when generated from `CompositeData.xml` but not auto or anchor based) slows down the first time using in simple and composite glyphs.
* **Complete Composites** is dimmed when editing empty glyphs in version 5.0 until 6.5.
* The program displays a critical error when using **Complete Composites** in some glyphs in the Private Use Area. After that, these glyphs cannot be recovered. [Bhikkhu Pesala](http://www.softerviews.org/Fonts.html), UK, the guy behind the sample glyphs and his fonts created by the same program, has assigned code points in the Private Use Area for different glyphs in his fonts, notably low profile diacritics and small capitals. Rebecca G. Bettencourt / [Kreative Korp](http://www.kreativekorp.com/), the girl behind Bits'n'Picas and her fonts created by the same program, has assigned code points in the Private Use Area for different glyphs in her fonts, notably extended block elements.
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 7.0 (2013-04-25) only adds glyphs with Unicode BMP mapping to the preview toolbar.
* Version 5.0 (2005-01-12) until 10.1.02272 (2016-12-20) uses Windows XP style icons whereas version 11.0.0.2365 (2017-05-10) & above uses a different icon set.
* In new fonts, the Euro (€) doesn't have a Macintosh Roman mapping but the international currency sign (¤) does have it.
* The euro (€) and international currency sign (¤) use the same mapping in the Macintosh Roman glyph mapping list.
* Version 1.0 until 5.6 uses ISO 8859-1 as the output encoding. East Asian users (e.g. Korean) will appreciate in `previewtext.dat` substitutes accented letters by ASCII counterparts, e.g. é by e and if kerning pairs are exported, instead of having &lt;&lt; for « you have to use \\00AB as escape code.

## Unregistered version limitations
As FontCreator is released as pay shareware, the unregistered version works for 30 days with the following limitations based on the version number.
* 3.0β1 (2000-07-30) until 3.1.3 (2002-12-09) - After a grace period of 30 days, a nag screen is shown when pressing **Start**. However, the program otherwise functions normally.
* 4.0 (2003-05-16) until 4.5 (2004-08-17) - After a grace period of 30 days, the program cannot be used at all until the registration process is started.
* 5.0 (2005-01-12) until 5.6 (2007-07-19) - After a grace period of 30 days and opening the program 5 times, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where e.g. fonts cannot be saved or tested.
* 6.0 (2009-06-17) and 8.0 (2014-06-05) until 12.0.0.2539 (2019-06-04) - The program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where e.g. tested fonts won't be automatically hinted.
* 7.0 (2013-04-25) - The program will create subsetted versions when saving, testing, exporting or installing fonts.
* 12.0.0.2543 (2019-07-10) - The program will add watermarks when generating fonts.

Under the Help menu is an item labeled **Register**. When executed, a screen will pop up giving the registration code.

## User Data (Glyph Transformer scripts and Unicode data files omitted)
FontCreator uses several data files for advanced settings and customizations. Normally most files are owned by administrators where they cannot be changed. If you want to edit most files directly they either must run Notepad with administrative privileges or change the owner to users (this can be done by using `takeown` or changing the owner with the advanced dialog of security tab in file properties).

* **bookmarks.txt** (version 5.0 until 6.5) – Created automatically after exit. Includes bookmarks used in the glyph overview.
* **CompositeData.xml** – Located in the `Composite` folder as used by **Complete Composites**.
* **CurrentTransformProgram.xml** – Created when opening Transform Programs in `TPERFORMTRANSFORMATIONFORM`. The window will appear empty if removed.
