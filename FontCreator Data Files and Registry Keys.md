FontCreator is a shareware font editor for Windows and macOS which supports fonts in TrueType (TTF), OpenType (OTF, EOT), and Web Open Font Format (WOFF, WOFF2) and TrueType font collections (TTC). Developed by [High-Logic B.V.](https://www.high-logic.com/) in 1997.

## Notes
* The cursor will remain **Busy** if the user is doing other stuff while saving fonts in the background.
* Exiting when saving fonts may create invalid font(s) and play the Critical Stop sound from the PC speakers.
* The program shows a critical error saying "access violation" when exiting while during some operations – the font(s) may be invalid.
* Glyphs in the clipboard (version 1.0 until 6.0) use "**Glyph Contours**" for contours and "**Glyph Data**" for glyphs. Version 7.0 & above stores the PostScript glyph name(s) as text (glyphs) or **Font Data** (contours).
* **Edit: Delete** is not dimmed on startup or when closing other dialogs in old versions.
* **Complete Composites** (when generated from `CompositeData.xml`, not auto or anchor based) times out two seconds when used the first time in simple and composite glyphs.
* **Complete Composites** is dimmed when editing empty glyphs in version 5.0 until 6.5.
* The program shows a critical error when using **Complete Composites** for some glyphs assigned by [Bhikkhu Pesala](http://www.softerviews.org/Fonts.html) in the Private Use Area (old versions only).
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 7.0 (2013-04-25) only supports characters mapped to the Basic Multilingual Plane in Windows Unicode when adding to the preview window.
* Version 5.6 (2007-07-19) uses a non-standard layout for all resources.
* In new fonts (version 5.0 until 6.5), the international currency sign (¤) is mapped to the Macintosh Roman platform but not the euro (€) which has the same codepoint (219).
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 6.5 (2011-11-18) used ISO/IEC 8859-1 (Latin-1) as the program's output encoding (the same is used for exported kerning pairs) while version 7.0 (2013-04-25) & above uses Unicode.
* The PostScript names modified when opening fonts in version 3.0 until 4.0 are as follows: **.notdef** is **notdef**, **nonmarkingreturn** is **CR** and **exclamdown** is **exclamationdown**.
* The installer was mirrored in **fontcreator.com** up to version 6.1.

## Unregistered version limitations
If the program detects it is an unregistered copy or is running as a limited user or if registration is not performed during or within the grace period, the following restrictions will be imposed on the version number:
* All versions – `TSPLASHFORM` is shown in startup. The title bar will display "unregistered" (version 5.0 & above) and the registration information in the about dialog states the program is unregistered. After a grace period of 30 days, the message in `TSPLASHFORM` is replaced with messages stating that the grace period is exceeded and asks to uninstall or buy the program. In version 6.0 & above there is a menu to register or buy the program.
* 3.0β1 (2000-07-30) until 3.1.3 (2002-12-09) – After a grace period of 30 days, it explains about shareware when pressing **Start** in `TSPLASHFORM`. However, the program otherwise functions normally.
* 4.0 (2003-05-16) until 5.0 (2005-01-12) – After a grace period of 30 days, the program cannot be used at all unless it is registered.
* 5.5 (2006-05-30) and 5.6 (2007-07-19) – After a grace period of 30 days and opening the program 5 times, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where fonts cannot be saved, tested or installed and TrueType collections cannot be extracted.
* 6.0 (2009-06-17) until 6.5 (2011-11-18) and 8.0 (2014-06-05) until 12.0.0.2539 (2019-06-04) – The program will enter a reduced functionality mode. The reduced functionality varies based on whether the program is in the grace period or not. In this case, fonts cannot be tested (version 6.0), installed or exported, OpenType collections cannot be extracted and tested fonts won't be automatically hinted.
* 7.0 (2013-04-25) until 11.5.0.2430 (2018-12-05) – The program will create subsetted versions when testing, installing or exporting fonts. (The glyphs are as follows: ! , - . = ? @ / \\, numbers, letters, fi and fl. Other characters are replaced by rectangles.) After a grace period of 30 days, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where font projects cannot be saved, fonts cannot be tested, installed or exported and OpenType collections cannot be extracted (`CheckLicenseNotGood` function from `OnShowDisabledMessage`).
* 12.0.0.2543 (2019-07-10) until 14.0.0.2894 (2022-11-22) – The program will replace random characters with the High-Logic logo in generated fonts. After a grace period of 30 days (7 days for 15.0.0.3024), the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where font projects cannot be saved, fonts cannot be tested, installed or exported and OpenType collections cannot be extracted (`CheckLicenseNotGood` function from `OnShowDisabledMessage`).

## User data
“FontCreator uses several extra data files to read settings and other program specific information.” Most files can be edited directly with administrator privileges.

* **CompositeData.xml** (version 5.0 & above) – Located in the `Composite` folder as used by **Complete Composites**. The feature will do nothing if the file has syntax errors or is missing. [Bhikkhu Pesala](http://www.softerviews.org/Fonts.html) had assigned code points in the Private Use Area for different glyphs in this file and his fonts (he removed them), notably for use with OpenType features like small capitals or old style numbers. This file is copied when pressing **Copy Data Files to User Data Folder** under **Options: Advanced: Data Files**.

Named after Erwin Denissen (the co-founder of High-Logic). León Fridsma (the other co-founder of High-Logic who joined in 2009) has not designed this font. It dates from the year 2000.
* **FC#####.otf/ttf** (desktop fonts in the test font window) or **FC#####.woff** (web fonts) – Temporary fonts whereas the last 5 characters in the filename are numbers. Version 3.0 until 6.5 named the font as **FC Test Font ######** while recent versions names the font up to 25 characters followed by 5 numbers.
* **fc12.cfg** (version 12.0) – Configuration file located in the user's directory.
* **FCOutDrw.dll** – Dynamic link library used by advanced outlines, located in the system root directory (version 10 & above).

* **FontInstaller.dll** (version 2.0 until 6.5) and **FontInstaller2.dll** (version 7.0 & above) – Dynamic link library for installing fonts.
* **glyphlist.dat** – List of PostScript names for glyphs in the Adobe glyph list. Old versions have the same list but it duplicates **xi** to the first Unicode codepoint. This file is copied when pressing **Copy Data Files to User Data Folder** under **Options: Advanced: Data Files**.
* **glyphnames.dat** (version 7.0 until 11.5) and **glyphnamesnew.dat** (version 12.0 & above) – “Contains overrides of the default friendly glyph names, as used when opening existing fonts (and fonts without PostScript names) and when you generate glyph names on the Glyph Properties dialog”.

* **tags.txt** (version 7.0 & above) – Contains the five tags which can be assigned to each glyph. Defaults are **Important**, **Incomplete**, **Completed**, **Review** and **Workspace**. This file is copied when pressing **Copy Data Files to User Data Folder** under **Options: Advanced: Data Files**.

In **Options: Advanced: Data Files** are two buttons labeled **Copy Data Files to User Data Folder** and **Open User Data Folder** (version 8.0 & above).
