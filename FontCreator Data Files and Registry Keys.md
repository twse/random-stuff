## Notes
* The cursor will remain **Busy** if the user does other stuff when saving fonts in the background.
* All versions can save all unaltered opened fonts from the menu (**File: Save All**). Windows 2000 & above shows a critical error that reads **List index out of bounds** if done repeatedly.
* Exiting the program when saving fonts may create invalid font(s) and play the Critical Stop sound from the PC speakers.
* The program shows a critical error that reads **access violation** when exiting while during some operations – the font(s) may be invalid.
* Glyphs in the clipboard (version 1.0 until 6.0) will either say **Glyph Contours** (contours) or **Glyph Data** (glyphs). Version 7.0 & above stores just the PostScript glyph name(s) as text (glyphs) or **Font Data** (contours).
* **Edit: Delete** is not dimmed on startup or when closing other dialogs in old versions.
* **Complete Composites** (when generated from `CompositeData.xml` but not auto or anchor based) slows down the first time when used in simple and composite glyphs.
* **Complete Composites** is dimmed when editing empty glyphs in version 5.0 until 6.5.
* The program shows a critical error when using **Complete Composites** in some glyphs in the Private Use Area (old versions only). After that, these glyphs cannot be recovered.
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 7.0 (2013-04-25) only adds glyphs with Unicode BMP mapping to the preview toolbar.
* FontCreator 5.6 has a non-standard resource layout which prevented [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) from packing the executable file (NotPackedException: not packed by UPX) but compression with or without parameters. Recent versions do not use this.
* In new fonts (version 5.0 until 6.5), the international currency sign (¤) is mapped to the Macintosh Roman platform but not the euro (€) mapping to the same codepoint (219).
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 6.5 (2011-11-18) used ISO Latin-1 as the output encoding for the program and exported kerning pairs while version 7.0 (2013-04-25) & above uses Unicode.

## Unregistered version limitations
If registration is not performed during or within the grace period, the following restrictions will be imposed on the version number:
* All versions – `TSPLASHFORM` is shown on startup. `TMAINFORMFONTCREATOR` will add a word to the title bar (version 5.0 & above) and the registration info in `TABOUTDIALOG` or `TABSTRACTABOUTDIALOG` states that the program is unregistered. After a grace period of 30 days, the message shown in `TSPLASHFORM` is replaced with a message stating that the grace period is exceeded and encourages the user to uninstall or buy the program.
* 3.0β1 (2000-07-30) until 3.1.3 (2002-12-09) – After a grace period of 30 days, `TSHAREWAREFORM` is shown when pressing **Start** in `TSPLASHFORM`. However, the program otherwise functions normally.
* 4.0 (2003-05-16) until 4.5 (2004-08-17) – After a grace period of 30 days, the program cannot be used at all until the registration process is started.
* 5.0 (2005-01-12) until 5.6 (2007-07-19) – After a grace period of 30 days and opening the program 5 times, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where fonts cannot be saved, tested or installed and TrueType collections cannot be extracted.
* 6.0 (2009-06-17) until 6.5 (2011-11-18) and 8.0 (2014-06-05) until 12.0.0.2539 (2019-06-04) – The program will enter a reduced functionality mode. The reduced functionality varies based on whether the program is in the grace period or not. In this case, fonts cannot be installed or exported, OpenType collections cannot be extracted from the **Tools** menu and tested fonts won't be automatically hinted.
* 7.0 (2013-04-25) until 11.5.0.2430 (2018-12-05) – The program will create subsetted versions when testing, installing or exporting fonts. After a grace period of 30 days, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where fonts cannot be tested, installed or exported and OpenType collections cannot be extracted from the **Tools** menu.
* 12.0.0.2543 (2019-07-10) until 12.0.0.2550 (2020-01-14) – The program will add watermarks when generating fonts. After a grace period of 30 days, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where fonts cannot be tested, installed or exported.

Under the **Help** menu is an item labeled **Register...** (the same item in version 12.0 is in **Help: Buy** along with **Buy Now** and `TTIPOFTHEDAYFORM` in version 3.0 until 6.5) when this executed a screen will pop up giving the registration code.

## Windows version compatibility
* Windows Vista and later – 12.0.0.2554
* Windows XP – 10.0
* Windows 2000 – 7.0
* Windows 95, 98, ME and NT 4.0 – 6.0.1

## User Data (Glyph Transformer scripts omitted)
To quote the user manual: FontCreator uses several data files for advanced settings and customizations. Normally most files are stored in a system folder where they cannot be changed. If you want to edit most files directly they either must have administrator permissions or change the owner (this can be done with `takeown /f filename` or **Security: Advanced: Owner: Edit** in Windows XP, Vista and 7 and **Security: Advanced: Owner: Change** in Windows 8 and 10 in file properties).

* **bookmarks.txt** (version 5.0 until 6.5) – Includes bookmarks used in `TFONTOVERVIEWFORM`. Created automatically when the user exits the program.
* **CompositeData.xml** – Located in the `Composite` folder as used by **Complete Composites**. The feature will do nothing if there are syntax errors or this file is removed. [Bhikkhu Pesala](http://www.softerviews.org/Fonts.html) had assigned code points in the Private Use Area for different glyphs in this file and his fonts (he removed them), notably for use with OpenType features like small capitals or old style numbers.
* **CurrentTransformProgram.xml** – Transform Program used by `TTRANSFORMFORM`. The window will appear empty if removed.
* **FC#####.ttf** – Temporary font used by `TFONTTESTFORM` (the last five characters in the filename are numeric). Version 3.0 until 6.5 names the font as **FC Test Font ######** (the last six characters are numeric).
* **fc12.cfg** (version 12.0) – Configuration file located in the user's directory.
* **FCOutDrw.dll** – Dynamic link library located in the system root directory used for advanced outlines (version 10 & above).
* **fcp5.cfg** (version 5.0 and 5.6) – Configuration file located in the system root directory.
* **fcppreview.txt** (version 3.0 until 4.5) – Text used in `TFONTTESTFORM`. The text is restored to factory defaults if removed.
* **fntXX.tmp** or **fntXXX.tmp** – Temporary font used when saving (the last two or three characters in the filename is a letter and/or number combo).
* **FontCreatorSetup.exe** – Install the Win32 version of this program.
* **FontCreatorSetup-x64.exe** (version 11.5 & above) – Install the Win64 version of this program.
* **FontCreator.tip** (version 2.0 until 6.5) – Contains paragraphs in `TTIPOFTHEDAYFORM` to store tips and tricks. The window will appear empty if removed.
* **FontCreator YYYYMMDD HHMMSS ###.dat/prd** – Contains crash info (located in `ProgramData\High-Logic\Errors` – YYYYMMDD HHMMSS is the timestamp and the last three characters are numeric).
* **FontInstaller.dll** (version 2.0 until 6.5) and **FontInstaller2.dll** (version 7.0 & above) – These dynamic link libraries are used by `TFONTINSTALLFORM`.
* **glyphlist.dat** – Contains the Adobe glyph list. Old versions have the same list but **xi** is duplicated as U+0000.
* **glyphnamesnew.dat** (version 7.0 & above) – Contains the default glyph names when opening existing fonts and when generating glyph names on `TGLYPHPROPERTIESFORM`. Prior to FontCreator 12 another file (`glyphnames.dat`) was used, but that one is now obsolete.
* **guidelines.dat** – Contains the guidelines used for `TGLYPHEDITFORM` and `TGUIDELINESFORM`. Created automatically when the user exits the program.
* **kern_font.txt** – For old versions of FontCreator, stores the old `KERN` table data in each font whereas `font` is the font name.
* **previewtext.dat** (version 5.0 & above) – Contains text used in `TFONTTESTFORM`. The text is restored to factory defaults if removed.
* **preview.txt** (version 4.5 & above) – Contains text strings used by the Preview toolbar in `TMAINFORMFONTCREATOR`. The dropdown list will appear empty if removed.
* **SubFamily.dat** or **SubFamily2.dat** – Contains naming fields for multiple languages.
* **TableOffsetOrderCFF.txt**, **TableOffsetOrder.dat** (old versions) or **TableOffsetOrder.txt** – Contains the supported tables in any font. All tables are moved to **Unsupported Tables** (`TFONTPROPERTIESFORM` in version 7.0 & above) or **Unsupported** (`TFONTTABLESFORM` in version 3.0 until 6.5) if these files are removed, making the font either invalid, unable to install or not work.
* **tags.txt** (version 7.0 & above) – Controls the names of the five tags that can be assigned to each glyph. Defaults are named Important, Incomplete, Completed, Review and Workspace.

In **Options: Advanced: Data Files** are two buttons labeled **Copy Data Files to User Data Folder** and **Open User Data Folder** when pressed the program will either copy most files in the above list to the user data folder or open it.
