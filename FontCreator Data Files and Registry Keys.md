FontCreator is a font editor and High-Logic's first product created since its foundation on 1997.

## Notes
* The cursor will remain **Busy** if the user does other stuff when saving fonts in the background.
* All versions can save all unaltered opened fonts from the File menu. Windows 2000 & above shows a critical error saying **List index out of bounds** if done repeatedly.
* Exiting when saving fonts may create invalid font(s) and play the Critical Stop sound from the PC speakers.
* The program shows a critical error saying **access violation** when exiting while during some operations – the font(s) may be invalid.
* Glyphs in the clipboard (version 1.0 until 6.0) will say **Glyph Contours** (contours) or **Glyph Data** (glyphs). Version 7.0 & above stores just the PostScript glyph name(s) as text (glyphs) or **Font Data** (contours).
* **Edit: Delete** is not dimmed on startup or when closing other dialogs in old versions.
* **Complete Composites** (when generated from `CompositeData.xml` but not auto or anchor based) slows down the first time when used in simple and composite glyphs.
* **Complete Composites** is dimmed when editing empty glyphs in version 5.0 until 6.5.
* The program shows a critical error when using **Complete Composites** in some glyphs in the Private Use Area (old versions only). After that, these glyphs cannot be recovered.
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 7.0 (2013-04-25) only adds glyphs with Unicode BMP mapping to the preview area.
* Version 5.6 (2007-07-19) uses a non-standard resource layout which prevents [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) from packing the executable file (`NotPackedException`).
* In new fonts (version 5.0 until 6.5), the international currency sign (¤) is mapped to the Macintosh Roman platform but not the euro (€) which maps to the same codepoint (219).
* Version 1.0 (1998-04-11) until 6.5 (2011-11-18) used ISO Latin-1 as the output encoding for the program and exported kerning pairs while version 7.0 (2013-04-25) & above uses Unicode.
* The PostScript names modified when opening fonts in Font Creator Program 3.0 and 4.0 are as follows: the full stop at **.notdef** is removed, **nonmarkingreturn** changes to **CR** and **exclamdown** changes to **exclamationdown**.
* High-Logic mirrored the installer in its own domain derived from the program name up to version 6.1.

## Unregistered version limitations
If the program detects it is an unregistered copy or if registration is not performed during or within the grace period or fails because of an illegal or invalid registration key, the following restrictions will be imposed on the version number:
* All versions – `TSPLASHFORM` is shown on startup. `TMAINFORMFONTCREATOR` will display a word in the title bar (version 5.0 & above) and the registration information in `TABOUTDIALOG` or `TABSTRACTABOUTDIALOG` states that the program is unregistered. After a grace period of 30 days, the message shown in `TSPLASHFORM` is replaced with messages stating that the grace period is exceeded and encourages the user to uninstall or buy the program. In version 6.0 & above there is a menu to register or buy the program in `TMAINFORMFONTCREATOR`.
* 3.0β1 (2000-07-30) until 3.1.3 (2002-12-09) – After a grace period of 30 days, `TSHAREWAREFORM` is shown when pressing **Start** in `TSPLASHFORM`. However, the program otherwise functions normally.
* 4.0 (2003-05-16) until 5.0 (2005-01-12) – After a grace period of 30 days, the program cannot be used at all unless it is registered.
* 5.5 (2006-05-30) and 5.6 (2007-07-19) – After a grace period of 30 days and opening the program 5 times, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where fonts cannot be saved, tested or installed and TrueType collections cannot be extracted.
* 6.0 (2009-06-17) until 6.5 (2011-11-18) and 8.0 (2014-06-05) until 12.0.0.2539 (2019-06-04) – The program will enter a reduced functionality mode. The reduced functionality varies based on whether the program is in the grace period or not. In this case, fonts cannot be tested (version 6.0), installed or exported, OpenType collections cannot be extracted and tested fonts won't be automatically hinted.
* 7.0 (2013-04-25) until 11.5.0.2430 (2018-12-05) – The program will create subsetted versions when testing, installing or exporting fonts. After a grace period of 30 days, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where font projects cannot be saved, fonts cannot be tested, installed or exported and OpenType collections cannot be extracted. This corresponds to the `CheckLicenseNotGood` function used by `OnShowDisabledMessage`.
* 12.0.0.2543 (2019-07-10) until 13.0.0.2643 (2020-05-19) – The program will replace `.notdef` and many glyphs with the company's logo in generated fonts. After a grace period of 30 days, the program will enter a reduced functionality mode, where font projects cannot be saved, fonts cannot be tested, installed or exported and OpenType collections cannot be extracted. This corresponds to the `CheckLicenseNotGood` function used by `OnShowDisabledMessage`.

## User data
“FontCreator uses several data files for advanced settings and customizations. Normally most files are stored in a system folder where they cannot be changed.” In order to edit most files directly it must have administrator permissions.
* **bookmarks.txt** (version 4.5 until 6.5) – Includes bookmarks used in `TFONTOVERVIEWFORM`. Created automatically after exiting the program.
* **CompositeData.xml** (version 5.0 & above) – Located in the `Composite` folder as used by **Complete Composites**. The feature will do nothing if there are syntax errors or this file is removed. [Bhikkhu Pesala](http://www.softerviews.org/Fonts.html) had assigned code points in the Private Use Area for different glyphs in this file and his fonts (he removed them), notably for use with OpenType features like small capitals or old style numbers. Updated versions are available in the company's forum.
* **CurrentTransformProgram.xml** (version 4.5 & above) – Transform Program used by `TTRANSFORMFORM`. The window will appear empty if removed.
* **default.otlfd** (version 7.0 until 11.5) – Default OpenType feature definitions used when adding common OpenType features. Replaced with `TFEATURESETTINGSFORM` in version 12 & above.
* **Denissen.ttf** (version 4.5 until 5.5 – located in the fonts folder) – This is a handwriting font with only ASCII characters. The font is named after the company founder's family name and dates from the year 2000.
* **FC#####.otf/ttf** – Temporary font used by `TFONTTESTFORM` (the last five characters in the filename are numeric). Version 3.0 until 6.5 names the font as **FC Test Font ######** and recent versions names the font as up to 25 characters preceded by 5 numbers.
* **FC#####.woff** – Temporary font used when testing web fonts.
* **fc12.cfg** (version 12.0) – Configuration file located in the user's directory.
* **FCOutDrw.dll** – Dynamic link library located in the system root directory used for advanced outlines (version 10 & above).
* **fcp5.cfg** (version 5.0 until 5.6) – Configuration file located in the system root directory.
* **fcppreview.txt** (version 3.0 until 4.5) – Text used in `TFONTTESTFORM`. The text is restored to factory defaults if removed.

* Checkbox: **Include Diagonals** (version 3.0) – The checkbox was dropped after version 4.0.
* Checkbox: **Remove Knees** (version 3.0) – The checkbox was dropped after version 4.0.

### Glyph Properties (`TGLYPHPROPERTIESFORM`)
Version 4.0 until 5.0 includes a text box which was intended to show the number of contours (see the status bar in **TMAINFORMFONTCREATOR** at the bottom).

### Automatic Metrics Wizard (`TAUTOMETRICSFORM`)
If the program detects it is running the Home Edition the Professional Edition note is shown (in the Professional Edition it is hidden). Version 10.0 includes three unused features (the features were dropped in version 11.0 & above).

The third panel changes the advance width with check boxes to center the glyph/set the left side bearing at x=0 and a radio button to use monospaced metrics (it is only active when the Fixed option is selected).

### OpenType Designer (`TOPENTYPEDESIGNERFORM`)
These buttons are shown when editing the GPOS kerning tables. The values at the beginning start with a capital D in square brackets.
* **Clear Values** – Set the value for all kerning pairs to 0. Useful for monospaced fonts that have a kerning table (e.g. *Monospaced Typewriter* by Manfred Klein).
* **Harmonize** – Harmonizes all kerning pairs in subtables.
* **Clean Up** – Removes all kerning pairs that have a kerning value of 0. Version 3.0 through 6.5 removes pairs that are made up with glyphs that are not connected to any Unicode character (except in version 7.0 & above).

### OpenType Layout Feature Editor (`TCODEEDITORFORM`)
* Checkbox: **VOLT.UseGlyphIds** – The checkbox is used for fonts with Microsoft VOLT projects only. The value at the beginning starts with Debug and a colon.

### Font Test Window (`TFONTTESTFORM`)
The context menu for `mmFontTest` has two paste options and a multiline text field at the bottom (`Memo1`) with the same text in Arial Bold (13 points). A double-click will change the font and size.

### Options Window (`TOPTIONSFORM`)
The **General** tab has a group to associate fonts with the program itself (it is in version 3.0 only and was dropped after version 4.0). The **Preview** tab includes three unused buttons to move strings up or down or to reset the list.

### About Dialog (`TABOUTDIALOG` and `TABSTRACTABOUTDIALOG`)
These are located in the corners of the program name, version number, copyright notice and the company's website.
* **Clr** (Clear) (version 4.5 & above, top left corner) – Removes registration information (see the `Reg` section in **Registry Keys** above). Before version 6.0 the text is white and is located in the registration information.
* **Crash** (top right corner) – Displays a critical error which reads "We hope you enjoyed clicking this crash button".
* **Trial** (bottom right corner, version 12.0 & above) – Reset the trial period for unregistered copies running after a grace period of 30 days.
