## Python Software Foundation Contributor License Agreement (PSF Contributor Signatories.htm)
Python Software Foundation has a contributor license agreement that you must sign to review or merge pull requests when contributing to Python (e.g. when updating the documentation to document things or fixing typos/grammar errors in comments in the source code or documentation).

Submissions are done in two days apart. You will receive a verification email and [the bug tracker](https://bugs.python.org/) will see an asterisk after the username for every comment posted in each issue. A CLA enforcement bot known by the name/repository from the GitHub Python organization **the-knights-who-say-ni** will add the **CLA signed** label for every created pull request (otherwise, if not signed, the **CLA not signed** label is added).

Make sure your Python bug tracker account has a GitHub username included (you can do this by logging in to your Python bug tracker account and going to the account settings page to set your username; only the Python bug tracker usernames are included).

This list represents but a portion of the people who have signed the Python Software Foundation Contributor License Agreement.

**P.S.** Don't add your name here, unless you really *are* after Marien alphabetically. It is not related to the Python Software Foundation code of conduct created in 2012.

### Check Python CLA app
Mariatta Wijaya created the [Check Python CLA](https://check-python-cla.herokuapp.com/) program to check each GitHub user to see if the contributor license agreement is signed.

## Ubuntu Code of Conduct (Ubunteros.htm)
Ubuntu has a code of conduct (Freeware under Creative Commons license) that you may sign with Launchpad or the [Code of Conduct Signing Assistant](https://launchpad.net/code-of-conduct-signing-assistant) (signed digitally or physically by the user) in this file - many teams require doing this like the [Ubuntu BugSquad](https://launchpad.net/~bugsquad). The instructions are in the Launchpad help documentation located [here](https://help.launchpad.net/Signing%20the%20Ubuntu%20Code%20of%20Conduct).

The entire text is located in the operating system's official website and can be read [here](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct). Typos, grammar errors and undocumented things should be reported to [Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-codeofconduct).

The Ubuntu product has very much been a team effort from development teams around Canonical and regional local communities and many, many people have contributed. This list represents but a portion of the people who have signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct.

**P.S.** Don't add your name here or anyone else who haven't signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct (if the **Signed Ubuntu Code of Conduct** value for each user says No), unless you really *are* after Hatem alphabetically. Make sure you have imported your OpenPGP key to sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. Ubunteros linked to deactivated Launchpad accounts are not listed.

### Code of Conduct Signing Assistant
The program was created in April 2013 and maintained by [Marten de Vries](https://launchpad.net/~marten-de-vries). The program is available under the GNU GPL 3.0 license.
