# Information
This repository contains my random stuff.
* **FontCreator Data Files and Registry Keys.md**: Includes data files and registry keys for FontCreator.
* **names.csv**: Names for adding to [Mozilla credits list](https://www.mozilla.org/credits). We know there are many Mozillians, past and present, who do not have Mozillians or Mozilla Bugzilla profiles. This includes former staff who have not updated their email address on Mozillians and Mozilla Bugzilla.
* **PSF Contributor Signatories.htm**: People who received the Python Software Foundation Contributor Agreement (partial list only).
* **SitePal Forum Drug Words.htm**: Toothpastes, drugs and medicine used to spam the old SitePal forum.
* **Ubunteros.htm**: Launchpad users who signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct (partial list only).

## Fonts
Created with CrystalTile2 and edited with FontCreator. All except LTROL Font and ZOE TFOM are released under the terms of the WTFPL license (see the license agreement in the font files). All fonts have only a regular type style, so don't apply bold or italic attributes, otherwise the OS will synthesise styles, which will bloat PDF files.
* **Cyrano Text** (named after Cyrano de Bergerac): Based on [Cyrano Nouveau](https://www.typophile.com/node/64838) (2009) by Tim Mott (MrMoto) with revised glyphs and support for more glyphs.
* **Generic Menu**: Adapted and converted from the GBA/DS versions of *WarioWare* (small font). Thanks to Jackster from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) for ripping the font.
* **LTROL Font**: Adapted and converted from the US version of *Lufia: The Ruins of Lore*.
* (Not present in this repository) [Uninstall MS Shell Dlg](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rAvLseIK4UEYbIe3l8ihXW_0t8xrc9eW&export=download) (Windows command line script). Use this script to uninstall Microsoft Sans Serif (linked to MS Shell Dlg) and Tahoma (linked to MS Shell Dlg 2) on Windows 2000 and XP if Windows File Protection is disabled or Windows Vista & above. The script takes ownership of both fonts, modifies the permission list entries and deletes the font files as well. The fonts are copyrighted by Microsoft. CMD files are presented with a virus scan warning before using the direct Google Drive download links.
* (Not present in this repository) [ReactOS Font Hack](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14gt8XYCDnO441Wa-h8aqgxUJ8qPrL76P&export=download) (Windows registry entries). Apply this hack to ReactOS if the Pan-European Supplementary Fonts from Windows 10 and 11 are installed. It modifies the `FontSubstitutes` to change existing or add new string values.
* **Readable Fonts**: Based on the System VIO font from OS/2 with revised glyphs and support for more glyphs. The fonts were created in 2014 as self-loading fonts and most characters were placed in a Unicode TrueType font from [the Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) by Vile Rancour derived from the IBM VGA 8×14 and 8×16 PxPlus fonts.
* (Not present in this repository) [SuperTux fonts in ROT-13](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tIPEov7J_wG8tZAN4QgNnqIqzKN6GD4Q&export=download). Only languages with Latin script are affected. Thanks to [Norman L. De Forest](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/Profile.html) (1942-2006) for converting his old ANSICHRW font.
* **ZOE TFOM**: Adapted and converted from the US/EU versions of *Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars* (Kanji letters omitted). The original characters in the game ROM horizontally flips two rows.

* **URL:** See second file entry in the index above.
* **Note:** Please do not add your name/someone else's names or modify existing entries to the abovementioned file in the source repository without filling in the form or replying to the form's application acceptance message via direct pull requests as they will be closed by the owner.
* **Fun fact:** The form linked to the credits page and its responses spreadsheet was created in November 20th, 2013 by Gervase Markham (the guy with access privileges and owner) to remove their request email address. Still has spammy entries to this day.

## Index of protest pages (requires JavaScript)
Thanks to [Norman L. De Forest](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/Profile.html) (1942-2006) for creating the original protest pages based on his profile page and the protest images for graphical browsers. Region locked sites are shown with a dagger and country names.
* **Web page not available** (Android) – The link in the paragraph refers to a page in the **@Macarlo, Inc** website (the domain was expired on July 1st, 2013).
* **Cannot find server** (Internet Explorer 6 – Windows XP Service Pack 3) – **Fun fact:** Many Internet Explorer versions use different text strings for some steps in the original page. The original page is available as an HTML resource in `shdoclc.dll` (Windows 98 & above), `xpsp2res.dll` (Windows XP Service Pack 2) and `xpsp3res.dll` (Windows XP Service Pack 3).
* **Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage** (Internet Explorer 7-10 – Windows XP SP2 & above) – In this page is a button labeled **Diagnose Connection Problems** (pressing when accessed as `res://shdocvw.dll/dnserror.htm` or `res://shdocvw.dll/dnserrordiagoff.htm` opens the network diagnostic tool if it is installed and present).
* **This page can't be displayed** (Internet Explorer 11) – The domain in the paragraph refers to a page in the **@Macarlo, Inc** website (the domain was expired on July 1st, 2013). In this page is a button labeled **Fix connection problems** (pressing when accessed as `res://ieframe.dll/dnserror(diagoff).htm` opens the network diagnostic tool if it is installed and enables the option from the **Tools** menu).
* **Page Load Error** (Firefox and other Mozilla browsers) – The **Address Not Found** text is from Splashtop Browser.
* **Error** (Otter Browser) – The same text is used in the Presto version of Opera.

The protest pages are as follows:
* **protest.htm** replaces HTML link tags with LINK in square brackets.
* **protest2.htm** replaces everything with IMAGE and INLINE in square brackets.
* **protest3.htm** protests against sites that use JavaScript URLs.
* **protest4.htm** protests against sites that use HTML external links so the links do nothing when selected.
* **protest5.htm** redirects to an "Unsupported Browser" page (see the page itself in the zipped archive for a partial list - the sites are listed in alphabetical order).

## Brief description of Sobreclick and translation info
Sobreclick is a simple auto-clicker for use with e.g. when deleting keys in Registry Editor.

I created the Czech, German, Polish and Russian translations with Microsoft Bing Translator.
