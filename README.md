# Information
This repository contains random stuff.
* **Cyrano Text**: TrueType Unicode font based on Cyrano Nouveau (2009) from the Typophile forums by MrMoto with some glyphs modified. Created using FontCreator 5.6 (2007). **Moderator's note:** Both fonts are named after Cyrano de Bergerac.
* **Generic Menu**: TrueType Unicode font based on the Made in Wario font. Thanks goes to Jackster from Spriters Resource for ripping the font.
* **Icons.zip**: Icons based on the lowercase letters of [bob's game font](http://www.bobcorporation.com/fonts/bobsgame.ttf) for use with OS/2 programs of the past and present. Requires OS/2 2.0 or higher under a file system that supports long filenames, e.g. HPFS or FAT32. (**Note:** Created with OS/2 Icon Editor. Software credits available at http://bobsgame.wikia.com/wiki/Extras)
* **LTROL Font**: TrueType Unicode font based on the font in the American version of Lufia: The Ruins of Lore (2003), excluding random glyphs which replaces portions of the Hiragana subset. Created using CrystalTile2 (2010) and FontCreator 5.6 (2007).
* **names.csv**: Names for adding in the [Mozilla credits list](https://www.mozilla.org/credits). In the early days, Dawn Endico was responsible for updating the list through CVS. **Moderator's note:** We know there are many Mozillians, past and present, who do not have Mozillians or Mozilla Bugzilla profiles. This includes former staff who have not updated their email address on Mozillians and Mozilla Bugzilla.
* **PSF Contributor Signatories.htm**: Includes people who received the contributor form from the Python Software Foundation (partial list only).
* **READBL Fonts**: Self-loading font family based on the “System VIO” font from OS/2. Some characters modified. They cover many languages written in Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew or Cherokee scripts. Created using utilities by Iván Llanas and Michael J. Mefford (PC Magazine).
* **SitePal Forum Drug Words.htm**: Words related to medicine excluding song artists – these were used to spam the SitePal legacy forums from February and March 2011 which no longer exists.
* **Ubunteros.htm**: Ubuntu members, Launchpad users and open source contributors who signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct (partial list only).
* **Ubuntu Member Home Pages.htm**: Websites for all Ubuntu members who have explicitly signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct (partial list only). The beginning paragraph is inspired by the old Netscape people page which was closed in 2008.
* **ZOE TFOM**: TrueType Unicode font based on the font used in USA/EUR versions of Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars (2002), excluding CJK Unified Ideographs. Created using CrystalTile2 (2010) and FontCreator 5.6 (2007). A Japanese subset for this font was planned but was cancelled.
