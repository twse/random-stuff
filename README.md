# Information
This repository contains my random stuff.
* **Cyrano Text**: TrueType Unicode font based on Cyrano Nouveau (2009) from the Typophile forums by MrMoto with some glyphs modified. Created using FontCreator 5.6 (2007). **Moderator's note:** Both fonts are named after the 1998 movie Cyrano de Bergerac.
* **FontCreator Data Files and Registry Keys.md**: Includes data files and registry keys for all versions of FontCreator.

* **names.csv**: Names for adding to [Mozilla credits list](https://www.mozilla.org/credits). We know there are many Mozillians, past and present, who do not have Mozillians or Mozilla Bugzilla profiles. This might include former staff who have not updated their email address on Mozillians and Mozilla Bugzilla. This list only accepts everyone added using the form at the bottom of this page.
* **PSF Contributor Signatories.htm**: People who received the Python Software Foundation Contributor Agreement (partial list only).
* **Readable Fonts**: Self-loading fonts based on “System VIO” from OS/2. Created with [FontEdit II by Iván Llanas](http://www.geocities.ws/ivan_llanas/software/fontedit2.html) and FONTEDIT by Michael J. Mefford for PC Magazine.
* **SitePal Forum Drug Words.htm**: Toothpastes, drugs and medicine used to spam the old SitePal forum.

* **ZOE TFOM**: TrueType Unicode font used in western versions of Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars (2002), excluding CJK Unified Ideographs. Created using CrystalTile2 (2010) and FontCreator 5.6 (2007). This font is not licensed or endorsed by Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc.

## Fonts
Created with CrystalTile2 and edited with old versions of FontCreator. All except LTROL Font and ZOE TFOM are released under the terms of the WTFPL license (see the license agreement field in the font files). All fonts have only a regular type style, so don't apply bold or italic attributes, otherwise the OS will synthesise styles, which will bloat PDF files.
* **Cyrano Text** (named after Cyrano de Bergerac): Based on [Cyrano Nouveau](https://www.typophile.com/node/64838) (2009) by Tim Mott (MrMoto) with revised glyphs and support for more glyphs.
* **Generic Menu**: Adapted and converted from the GBA/DS versions of *WarioWare* (small font). Thanks to Jackster from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) for ripping the font.
* **LTROL Font**: Adapted and converted from the US version of *Lufia: The Ruins of Lore*.
* (Not present in this repository) [Uninstall MS Shell Dlg](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1rAvLseIK4UEYbIe3l8ihXW_0t8xrc9eW&export=download) (Windows command line script). Use this script to uninstall Microsoft Sans Serif (linked to MS Shell Dlg) and Tahoma (linked to MS Shell Dlg 2) on Windows 2000 and XP if Windows File Protection is disabled or Windows Vista & above. The script takes ownership of both fonts, modifies the permission list entries and deletes the font files as well. The fonts are copyrighted by Microsoft. CMD files are presented with a virus scan warning before using the direct Google Drive download links.
* (Not present in this repository) [ReactOS Font Hack](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14gt8XYCDnO441Wa-h8aqgxUJ8qPrL76P&export=download) (Windows registry entries). Apply this hack to ReactOS if the Pan-European Supplementary Fonts from Windows 10 and 11 are installed. It modifies the `FontSubstitutes` to change existing or add new string values.
* **Readable Fonts**: Based on the System VIO font from OS/2 with revised glyphs and support for more glyphs. The fonts were created in 2014 as self-loading fonts and most characters were placed in a Unicode TrueType font from [the Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) by VileR derived from the IBM VGA 8×14 and 8×16 PxPlus fonts.
* (Not present in this repository) [SuperTux fonts in ROT-13](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tIPEov7J_wG8tZAN4QgNnqIqzKN6GD4Q&export=download). Only languages with Latin script are affected. Thanks to [Norman L. De Forest](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/Profile.html) (1942-2006) for converting his old ANSICHRW font.
* **ZOE TFOM**: Adapted and converted from the US/EU versions of *Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars* (Kanji letters omitted). The original characters in the game ROM horizontally flips two rows.

## Otter Browser User Agents (Not present in this repository)

## Mozilla credits list module info
* **Description:** Shows a list of all those who contributed to Mozilla. The original list was created in August 1999.
* **Owners:** Ram Dayal Vaishnav (2017-present – GIT), Mohammad Shahbaz Alam (2019-present – GIT)
* **Owners Emeritus:** Dawn Endico (1999-2003 – CVS), Gervase Markham (2003-2017 – CVS, GIT and SVN)
* **Source Dir:** GitHub Repository `mozilla/community-data/credits` (`names.csv` file)
* **URL:** See second file entry in the index above.
* **Note:** Please do not add your name/someone else's names or modify existing entries to the abovementioned file in the source repository without filling in the form or replying to the form's application acceptance message via direct pull requests as they will be closed by the owner.
* **Fun fact:** The form linked to the credits page and its responses spreadsheet was created in November 20th, 2013 by Gervase Markham (the guy with access privileges and owner) to remove their request email address. Still has spammy entries to this day.
**P.S.** The first owner created the page via CVS in 1999/08/29 and posted a message to the Mozilla internationalization and SeaMonkey newsgroups. The second owner wrote management tools in 2011/03 when he added many previous localizers via SVN and committed directly via GIT without pull requests. The third owner commits with pull requests and closes them for additions not from the form (e.g. bulk additions) or modifications not from replies to the application message with a comment.

## Protest pages (requires JavaScript; available in five versions)
Thanks goes to [Norman L. De Forest](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/), Canada (1942-2006) for his protest pages. His own protest page uses the index page and are available in seven versions. Region locked sites are shown with a dagger and country names.
* **Web page not available** (Android) – The link refers to a page at the **@Macarlo, Inc** website (currently down since 2013/07/01).
* **Cannot find server** (Internet Explorer 6 – Windows XP RTM, SP1 and SP2) – Windows XP SP3 added network diagnostics stuff (not included in this page).
* **Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage** (Internet Explorer 7-10 – Windows XP SP2 & above) – In this page is a button labeled **Diagnose Connection Problems** (pressing in the browser itself when the original page is accessed as `res://shdocvw.dll/dnserror.htm` opens the network diagnostic tool).
* **This page can't be displayed** (Internet Explorer 11) – In this page is a button labeled **Fix connection problems** (pressing in the browser itself when the original page is accessed as `res://ieframe.dll/dnserror.htm` opens the network diagnostic tool – the button is also in the **Tools** menu). Remove the style in `notConnectedTasks`, add the style to `cantDisplayTasks` and change the heading/title to **You're not connected to the internet** to make this page resemble computers not connected to the internet.
