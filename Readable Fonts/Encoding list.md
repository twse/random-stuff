### Notice when loading fonts through LOADFONT
LOADFONT (1993) from FNTCOL version 1.6 cannot handle long filenames or directory names.  If you want to pass these to LOADFONT you will have to rename or abbreviate them to their 8.3 character DOS filenames from the tables at the beginning.  EG: **Atari ST Encoding.f16** is **ATARIS~1.F16** and that is what you would have to pass to LOADFONT.
