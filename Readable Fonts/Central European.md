## Fonts
* Central European Starter Kit (1997), by Peter Cassetta (Fingertip Software), comes with a bitmap font for keycaps and two TrueType fonts, Timesse and Couriere. The fonts are tri-encoded (Unicode, ISO 8859-2 and Windows CE) but have no Apple CE, Windows Baltic or IBM CP852 glyphs.
* EUROPEAN, by Howard M. Berlin, is a series of cannibal non-Unicode fonts and a Windows 3.1 package which comes with Arial, Courier and Times-like fonts. These fonts cannot be used for regular text.
* ILPRumanianB100 (1996), by Charles J. Coker, is designed for typing Romanian text on English keyboards. The numbers are old-style.
* TITUS Eastern European (1995), by Jost Gippert, is a font derived from Times New Roman and contains letters for Baltic languages, accented Lithuanian and Slavic languages in Latin script. The encoding type is MS Symbol, and the characters (including "space") are placed in the Unicode "Private Use" block, which has the side-effect that word-wrap may not work. The Garamond-looking style font has no word-wrap problems.
